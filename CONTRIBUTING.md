## Adding new component

This will create all the initial files of `ExampleComponent` for you.
## Tooling
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) Package and dependency management
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) Module bundling
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) UI testing and documenting
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io), [React testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) Testing components and functionalities
- [Rollup plugin visualizer](https://github.com/btd/rollup-plugin-visualizer) To analyze bundle to see which modules are taking up space.
- [Auto changelog](https://github.com/cookpete/auto-changelog) For automating changelog generation

>  **How to analyze the bundle size?**
>
> We use `Rollup plugin visualizer` to analyze the bundle size.
>
> run <span style="background:#dadadb">npm run build</span> which will create `stats.html` in project root. Open up the file with your desired browser and check file sizes from a treemap graph.
